# Ultra Sans provenance

This document records the exact sources, construction, licenses, and committed
artifacts for **Ultra Sans**. Product typography roles and fallback policy belong
to consuming applications rather than this font repository.

## Authorship and project context

Ultra Sans was designed and authored by **Amil Khan**, a PhD student in the
Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of
California, Santa Barbara. Khan created the family for **Ultra**, an agentic
system for science, and directed its geometry, programmatic construction,
OpenType features, and visual evaluation.

This authorship describes the Ultra Sans derivative work. DM Sans and Inter
retain their original credits, copyrights, and licenses as recorded below. The
UCSB affiliation identifies the author and does not imply University endorsement
or make Ultra Sans an official University typeface. See
[AUTHORSHIP.md](AUTHORSHIP.md) for the formal statement and citation.

## Ultra Sans — the product face

Ultra Sans is a derivative of **DM Sans** closing three structural gaps: no
tabular figures (`tnum` generated; stock digits span 310/1000em so
`font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` silently did nothing), no Greek (grafted in
from Inter — see below), and the weakest `0`/`O` distinction of every candidate
face measured (a generated slashed-zero alternate behind a dormant `zero`
feature).

Built by `font-lab/build_ultra_tabular.py`, which fetches the upstream
masters, verifies them against the digests below, performs the feature additions
and reference C/O/G + lowercase `s` redraws, renames the family, and emits
WOFF2. The build is byte-reproducible (`head.modified` pinned to upstream), so
the output digests below are stable and re-derivable.

License: SIL Open Font License 1.1, preserved verbatim as `licenses/OFL-DM-Sans.txt`
(4389 bytes). DM Sans declares **no Reserved Font Name** — its copyright line is
bare — so renaming and redistributing a modified version is permitted outright.
Obligations met: the upstream copyright (name ID 0) and license (IDs 13/14) are
carried through untouched, the derivative note is appended to the description
rather than substituted, and Ultra Sans itself remains under OFL 1.1.
Name ID 9 leads with Amil Khan and retains the DM Sans and Inter design lineage;
IDs 10–12 record the full authorship statement and project URLs. The build
verifies both the new authorship metadata and the protected upstream records.

### What was added, and why it is safe

The numeric feature does not alter source outlines: each tabular digit is a
**composite** of the original digit, recentred inside a shared advance, so the
base figure and all of its variation are inherited. The deliberate exception is
the documented `C O G Q Ø` and lowercase `s` redraws below.

Three measured facts underpin the construction, all re-checked by the build:

1. **`0` is the widest digit at every axis location** (verified over opsz 9–40 ×
   wght 100–1000). So the tabular advance is exactly `advance(zero)` — a quantity
   read from the font, not modelled.
2. **Advances flow from gvar phantom points; HVAR is dropped.** The italic's
   HVAR diverged from its shipped phantom deltas by up to 4 units on some glyphs,
   so the build rebuilds every glyph's phantom advance deltas from HVAR-true
   advances sampled at all 12 master locations (verified exact afterwards), then
   removes HVAR. Every glyph — original, tabular, grafted — carries its advance
   the same way.
3. The centring shift is a *linear* function of the two advances, and gvar deltas
   are additive, so the shift's deltas are that same linear combination of the
   base digits' advance deltas — again exact, with no modelling.

Digits are centred on their **ink**, not their advance box; centring the advance
box left `1` 44 units off centre in its cell. The ink correction is near-constant
across the axes (worst drift 10 units, 0.15px at 15px), so it is applied
statically. Residual off-centring is ≤8 units (0.12px at 15px) across the weights
Ultra actually uses, rising to 21 units only at wght 1000 / opsz 40, which Ultra
never renders.

Default figures remain **proportional**, as they should for prose; the tabular
set is reached only through `tnum`, which is what `font-variant-numeric:
tabular-nums` activates.

### Greek, grafted in — no longer a CSS-fallback concern

Stock DM Sans covers one Greek codepoint (π) out of 403 total; Ultra renders λ,
σ, Δ, θ constantly, and the old CSS fallback could not reach canvas text
(`ctx.font` names a single family) nor weight-match per master. The build grafts
**104 Greek codepoints** from Inter (OFL, no Reserved Font Name), solved per
location of the two-axis design space: DM Sans's gvar regions map to a grid of
**12 master locations** (opsz {9, 24, 40} × wght {100, 300, 400, 1000},
intermediates included), and at each one Inter's own axes are solved so stems
and x/cap proportions match DM's there — plus a horizontal correction that keeps
Greek tracking DM's width rhythm where Inter's opsz axis saturates. Deltas come
from fontTools' VariationModel over those locations, so the graft is exact at
every master and interpolates with the same support math as the rest of the
font; italic grafts are additionally sheared 0.6° to DM's −10°. Verified by stem
comparison (λ vs l) and x-height alignment (σ vs x) at Ultra's real tokens
(wght 440/695, opsz 13), and at the axis extremes.

### Reference-matched C O G Q Ø — drawn at every master

The supplied small-size reference is optically corrected rather than
mathematically circular. Its `O` is subtly vertical; `C` is narrower and more
open; `G` is narrower than `O` and uses a long horizontal bar. At the normal
text master, the superseded geometric treatment measured `C .927 / O 1.000 /
G 1.000`; the redraw measures `C .825 / O .865 / G .834`. In a like-for-like
30px raster proxy for the reference's 10–11 CSS px capture, Inter had the lowest
mean absolute pixel error of DM Sans, the old Ultra Sans, Inter, and DM Sans Mono.

Inter therefore supplies the round-cap skeleton and terminal geometry. At each
of DM Sans's 12 `wght × opsz` master locations, the build solves the matching
Inter optical size, solves Inter's weight again against DM's capital-round side
stroke, scales to DM's round overshoot height, and shears italic outlines the
0.6° needed to land on DM's −10° angle. `C O G Q Ø` are written into the
existing DM glyph slots, retaining their names, original DM advances, and DM ink
centres. GPOS coverage, line lengths, and surrounding spacing therefore remain
stable while the silhouettes change. DM Sans Mono is used as the 10px
G-bar clarity check, not an outline donor; its compressed proportions belong in
code, not proportional body text.

All samples share point structure before gvar deltas are emitted. Build-time
verification checks the reference proportions, DM-matched stroke and overshoot,
unchanged advances, and the original mark-to-bowl relationship in `Ç Ö Ğ`
across regular, italic, text, display, and axis extremes. `Q` and `Ø` follow the
same bowl system so the change does not stop at the three specimen letters.

### Reference-matched lowercase s — sentence rhythm at body size

The approved reference was a 24×32-device-pixel crop. At that exact raster
height, the DM-derived Ultra `s` measured `0.782` width/height with nearly equal
upper/lower ink mass (`0.988`); the reference measured `0.750` and `0.948`.
Its smaller upper bowl, fuller lower bowl, stronger diagonal waist, and 2–5%
more open exits keep repeated `s` shapes from becoming wide, dark interruptions
inside a sentence. Inter opsz 20 / wght 430 was the closest measured source;
changing only DM's weight or optical size did not reproduce the white shape.

Inter therefore supplies the roman and italic skeleton. DM opsz `9/24/40`
samples Inter `14/29/32`, placing Ultra's actual body setting (opsz 15 / wght
430) near the approved opsz-20 reference. At every one of the 12 masters, the
source is independently weight-solved against DM's lowercase stem and scaled
uniformly to DM's exact `s` overshoot. Both original sidebearings are retained;
the advance changes only by the ink-width delta. The normal body result is
aspect `0.763` with an 11-unit advance reduction (about 0.17 px at 15 px), while
extreme bold masters may widen enough to preserve their counters. Composite
deltas keep `ś/š` and the other accented forms centred over the new base.

Build-time verification pins the body silhouette, normal/italic narrowing,
side-space, vertical overshoot, accent relationships, and interpolation across
the complete weight and optical-size grid.

### Slashed zero — capability, dormant by default

`zero.slash` (plus `zero.tnum.slash` so tabular contexts compose) is generated
per master location from the 0's own geometry — slash angle from the counter,
thickness from the 0's own thin stroke, so it tracks both axes like a drawn
glyph. Reached only through the `zero` OpenType feature, which nothing enables
by default: the documented doctrine is that identity does not come from
substituted glyphs, so defaults are untouched and data surfaces opt in with
`font-variant-numeric: slashed-zero` where `0`/`O` ambiguity actually costs
something (run IDs, hashes).

These two WOFF2 files are checked into `sources/inter/` as deterministic build

capitals, and lowercase `s`; the builder validates both SHA-256 digests before
reading them. They are not Ultra Sans release artifacts.
