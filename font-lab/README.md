# Ultra Sans — font lab

The shipping builder and an earlier experiment live here. Both produce
derivative typefaces without a font editor or proprietary outline source.

| Script | Base | What it does | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `build_ultra_tabular.py` | DM Sans + Inter | `tnum` + Greek graft + reference C/O/G and `s` + dormant slashed zero | **ADOPTED — the shipping product face (Ultra Sans)** |
| `build_ultra_sans.py` | Inter v4.1 | Bakes Inter's alternates in as defaults | Explored, never adopted |

The adopted build emits the committed release files in `../fonts/`. The Inter
experiment below is retained for its measurements, which still inform the type
system even though its output was never shipped. Ultra's application-level
monospace remains a separate concern.

## `build_ultra_tabular.py` — the shipping face

```bash
uv run python font-lab/build_ultra_tabular.py              # build + verify
uv run python font-lab/build_ultra_tabular.py --verify-only
```

Stock DM Sans ships **no `tnum` feature** and proportional digits spanning
310/1000em, so `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` had nothing to activate and
Ultra's right-aligned numeric columns staggered. CSS cannot fix that; it needs
glyphs. This adds ten `<digit>.tnum` composites plus the feature — and, since
the same rebuild: **104 Greek codepoints grafted from Inter** (solved per master
location over the wght x opsz grid, horizontal-corrected where Inter's opsz
saturates), **reference-matched C/O/G and lowercase `s` outlines**, and a
**generated slashed zero** behind a dormant `zero` feature.

Three measured facts keep it exact rather than modelled — see the module
docstring for the full reasoning:

1. **`0` is the widest digit at every axis location** (checked over opsz 9–40 ×
   wght 100–1000), so the tabular advance *is* `advance(zero)`.
2. **HVAR is dropped after a phantom-advance rebuild** — the italic's HVAR
   diverged from its phantoms by up to 4 units, so HVAR-true advances are
   sampled at all 12 master locations, every glyph's phantom deltas are rebuilt
   from them (verified exact), and HVAR is removed; all advances flow one way.
3. The centring shift is linear in the advances and gvar deltas are additive, so
   the shift's deltas are the same linear combination of the base digits'.

**Two traps worth remembering.** Sampling the axis corners and writing absolute
deltas is wrong — gvar deltas are additive residuals, so the `{opsz,wght}` corner
double-counts what `{opsz}` and `{wght}` already contributed; that overshot by 51
units (7%) at opsz 40 / wght 1000. And leaving the four phantom points `None`
pins the advance to its default everywhere, which looks fine at 400 and collides
once weight widens the digits.

Digits are centred on **ink**, not the advance box: centring the box left `1` 44
units off centre. The ink correction is near-constant across the axes (drift 10
units, 0.15px at 15px) so it is applied statically.

Builds are byte-reproducible (`recalcTimestamp=False`). The builder pins each
output's size and SHA-256 digest in addition to inspecting its OpenType tables,
so a passing verification proves both artifact identity and feature presence.

### Round capitals: reference shape, Ultra metrics

`C O G` were previously forced toward perfect circles. That looked geometric
at display scale but missed the supplied 10–11px reference: its `O` is subtly
vertical, `C` is narrower and more open, and `G` is narrower than `O` with a
long, immediately legible horizontal bar. At the normal text master, the old
outline aspects were `C .927 / O 1.000 / G 1.000`; the redraw is
`C .825 / O .865 / G .834`, matching the reference's closest source geometry.

The build now reconstructs `C O G Q Ø` at all 12 masters from three explicit
roles:

- **Inter** supplies the round-cap skeleton and aperture/terminal geometry; at
  the reference raster size it had the lowest mean pixel error of the measured
  candidates.
- **DM Sans** remains the typeface system: each Inter master is weight-solved
  to DM's round-cap stroke and scaled to its overshoot height, while the
  original DM advance and optical centre stay fixed. Kerning coverage and line
  lengths therefore do not move.
- **DM Sans Mono** is the 10px diagnostic for G-bar clarity, not an
  outline donor. Its compressed widths are useful in code but would reduce
  recognition in proportional body text.

The roman and italic use the same construction. Point structure is checked
before variation deltas are written; the build then verifies C/O/G proportions,
stroke agreement, cap overshoot, unchanged advances, and the mark-to-bowl
relationships in `Ç Ö Ğ` across the axis grid. The build's verification checks
these invariants at every master; use `specimen/index.html` at 10–16px for the
final raster review.

### Lowercase `s`: sentence rhythm at text size

The approved reference was supplied as a 24×32-device-pixel crop. Compared at
that exact raster height, current Ultra's DM-derived `s` measured `0.782`
width/height and was nearly equal in upper/lower ink mass (`0.988`). The
reference measured `0.750` and `0.948`: a smaller upper bowl, fuller lower
bowl, stronger diagonal waist, and 2–5% more open exits. Inter opsz 20 / wght
430 was the closest local skeleton; changing only DM's weight or optical size
did not reproduce the internal white shape.

The build reconstructs `s` at all 12 Ultra masters from Inter's roman/italic
progression. DM opsz `9/24/40` samples Inter `14/29/32`, placing Ultra's real
body setting (opsz 15 / wght 430) near the measured opsz-20 reference. Each
source master is independently weight-matched to DM's lowercase stem and
uniformly scaled to DM's exact `s` overshoot. The old left and right sidebearings
are preserved; the advance changes only by the new ink-width delta, so the
narrower body glyph improves repeated-word rhythm without introducing loose
spacing. Composite deltas keep the accents in `ś/š` centred over the new base.

The normal body result is aspect `0.763` with an 11-unit advance reduction
(about 0.17 px at 15 px). Verification pins that body silhouette, side-space,
overshoot, italic narrowing, accent relationships, and axis interpolation.

## `build_ultra_sans.py` — the Inter experiment (not adopted)

Produces a derivative from the Inter Variable v4.1 binaries. No font editor
required, no new outlines drawn: it reassigns which of Inter's *existing* 2,937
glyphs are the default ones.

```bash
uv run python font-lab/build_ultra_sans.py --all
python -m http.server 5310 --directory font-lab   # then open /specimen.html
```

Outputs land in `build/` and are **not release artifacts**. This historical
experiment remains separate from the adopted DM Sans + Inter pipeline above.

## What it does

Inter ships alternate letterforms behind 22 OpenType feature tags (`cv01`–`cv14`,
`ss01`–`ss08`). Normally you opt into them per-element with
`font-feature-settings`. This pipeline makes a chosen set **permanent and
default**, producing a genuinely different font file rather than a CSS setting.

Three recipes are defined in [`recipe.toml`](recipe.toml):

| Recipe | Glyphs moved | Character |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `stock` | 0 | Renamed Inter. The control. |
| `calm` | 89 | Tailed `l`, serifed `I`, slashed `0`, open `3 4 6 9`. Reads as Inter; stops `l`/`I`/`1` and `O`/`0` being ambiguous. |
| `geometric` | 193 | Adds single-storey `a`, spurless `u`, straight `t`, tailless `f`, spurred `G`. Pulls toward Futura/Avenir. |

## Why transplant, not "feature freeze"

The standard trick for baking in a feature is to rewrite `cmap` so U+0061 points
at `a.1`. **That is wrong for Inter**, and the font itself says so — two facts
measured from the binary:

1. The letter alternates are not metric-compatible: `a.1` is 104 units wider
   than `a`, `I.1` is 353 wider.
2. **Inter's GPOS coverage does not contain the letter alternates.** `a.1`,
   `u.1`, `G.1`, `t.1`, `f.1`, `I.1` and `l.ss02` appear in no kern pair and no
   kern class. (The *digit* alternates do.)

A cmap freeze would therefore silently drop every kern pair touching `a` — one
of the most-kerned glyphs in Latin text — and you would not see it until the
font was in production looking subtly wrong.

So the pipeline goes the other way. It copies the alternate's outline, advance
width, `gvar` deltas and `HVAR` advance index **into the default glyph's slot**,
keeping the glyph *name*. Every GPOS coverage table, kern class, mark anchor and
GSUB context still resolves, because to the rest of the font `a` is still `a`.

This is safe because the substitution maps have **zero overlap between keys and
values** — no alternate is itself the base of another substitution — so
transplants never cascade and order does not matter. The builder asserts this
(`_assert_disjoint`) and refuses to build if it ever stops being true.

Verified on the built binaries: each transplanted outline is identical to
Inter's corresponding alternate; both variable axes (`wght` 100–900,
`opsz` 14–32) survive; all 2,937 glyphs and all 10 GPOS lookups are retained.

## The reference: TWK Lausanne, and the `opsz` finding

The design reference is [TWK Lausanne](https://weltkern.com/typefaces/019497c9-4357-7256-87c4-0ae3fb803854)
(Nizar Kazan / Weltkern) — a neo-grotesque in the Folio/Helvetica line, which
puts it in the same family as Inter. It is a commercial typeface: we take
direction from it, we do not copy its outlines.

Measuring both with the same canvas ink method turned up something more useful
than any glyph swap. **The Lausanne webfont is static** — no `opsz` axis, no
`wght` axis, identical proportions at every size. Inter is variable, and its
optical-size axis narrows the round lowercase by ~8.5% between `opsz` 14 and 32.

Advance widths, em-normalised:

| Glyph | Inter `opsz` 32 | Inter `opsz` 14 | Lausanne | Gap at `opsz` 14 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `o` | 0.549 | 0.600 | 0.598 | −0.3% |
| `e` | 0.536 | 0.583 | 0.580 | −0.5% |
| `a` | 0.518 | 0.562 | 0.555 | −1.2% |
| `n` | 0.547 | 0.591 | 0.584 | −1.2% |
| `g` | 0.565 | 0.613 | 0.621 | +1.3% |
| `c` | 0.523 | 0.571 | 0.581 | +1.8% |
| `H` | 0.708 | 0.743 | 0.714 | −3.9% |
| `t` | 0.311 | 0.327 | 0.347 | +6.1% |
| `O` | 0.749 | 0.765 | 0.817 | +6.8% |

Vertical proportions are near-identical: x-height 0.516 vs 0.517, descender
0.204 vs 0.200. Lausanne's caps are 1.9% shorter (0.714 vs 0.728).

So **Inter's text optical size already has Lausanne's lowercase proportions.**
The apparent gap is entirely Inter's display narrowing — and `typography.css`
sets `font-optical-sizing: auto` at `:root`, so every heading in Ultra gets the
narrowed cut. Pinning `opsz` low at display sizes recovers the generous, round,
Lausanne-like feel for the cost of one CSS declaration:

```css
.display-heading { font-optical-sizing: none; font-variation-settings: "opsz" 14; }
```

See [`optical.html`](optical.html) for the side-by-side. At body size the two
are indistinguishable — the axis has barely moved by then — so this is a
display-only change.

**What this does not reach.** Lausanne's round capitals are wider (`O` +6.8%)
while its straight capitals are narrower (`H` −3.9%) and shorter. That is more
contrast between round and square capitals than Inter has, and it is a property
of the outlines. No axis setting or feature swap produces it; it needs drawing.

## Three references, and what they agree on

`references.html` compares Inter against **Graphik** (Commercial Type),
**Söhne** (Klim) and **TWK Lausanne** (Weltkern). Graphik renders straight from
the macOS system font asset — nothing vendored. All three are proprietary and
appear as on-screen references only; the experiment's generated outputs derive
from Inter (OFL) and nothing else.

| Reference | Best-fit Inter `opsz` (width) | RMS width error | x/cap | `opsz` matching that x/cap |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Graphik | 17.04 | 3.46% | 0.7315 | 22.1 |
| Söhne Buch | 27.00 | 1.86% | 0.7284 | 23.5 |
| TWK Lausanne | 16.65 | 2.27% | 0.7240 | 25.4 |
| Inter `opsz` 14 | — | — | **0.7503** | — |
| Inter `opsz` 32 | — | — | **0.7087** | — |

**Graphik fits worst** — not because it sits far away on average, but because it
has a width signature a single axis cannot reproduce: narrow `s` (−7.5% against
its own best fit), wide `t` (+9.5%), wide round capitals (`O` +6.4%). Scaling
`opsz` moves every glyph together; it cannot make `s` narrow and `t` wide at once.

**What all three agree on.** Their x-height relative to cap height lands within
1% of each other (0.724–0.732) — and all three sit well below Inter at text
sizes (0.750). That one number is most of why Inter reads as a UI typeface and
these read as brand typefaces: Inter's x-height is deliberately taller so small
text holds up on screen. Inter's own axis crosses the references' consensus at
about `opsz` 24. Everything else in these tables is width; this is proportion.

## Weight: why Söhne looks darker, and the Inter setting that matches it

Söhne reads darker than Inter at the same size because its strokes are thicker
**relative to its letters**, not in absolute terms. Inter's absolute stem is only
2.7% thinner — but Inter's x-height is larger, so the same stroke covers
proportionally less:

| | stem (em) | x-height | stem / x-height | rendered ink density | vs Söhne |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Söhne Buch | 0.0900 | 0.5230 | 0.1721 | 112.3 | — |
| Graphik Regular | 0.0840 | 0.5230 | 0.1606 | 99.8 | −11.2% |
| Inter 400 | 0.0876 | 0.5444 | 0.1609 | 107.8 | −4.0% |
| **Inter 430** | **0.0937** | 0.5444 | **0.1721** | **112.4** | **+0.1%** |

Two independent methods agree on **`wght` 430**: solving stem/x-height from the
outlines lands at 431, and rasterising a real sentence then integrating ink over
the x-height band lands at 430. The solve is stable across the optical range
(429–431 for `opsz` 14–27) because Inter's x-height does not move with weight.

`weight.html` renders the ladder. Note that **Graphik is the lightest of the
three by a wide margin** — 11% below Söhne — which is why it reads as airy.

**A metric that misleads.** Ink per unit of *line length* shows Inter 400 and
Söhne as identical (0.88 each), because Söhne is narrower and packs equal ink
into a shorter line. Perception follows ink per unit of *letter area* — you read
letters, not line-inches. Use the band-normalised figure.

**Not a lever:** `-webkit-font-smoothing`. Ultra's app CSS does not set it while
the other font-lab pages do, which looked like it might explain part of the gap.
It does not — on a Retina Mac macOS uses grayscale antialiasing regardless, so
the property is close to a no-op. Measured and ruled out.

**Historical knock-on.** At the time of this experiment, Ultra's ladder was
body 400, nav/data/action 500, label/heading 600, strong 700. The adopted system
now gives body its measured 430 grade while preserving deliberately distinct
navigation, heading, and emphasis roles.

## Söhne — why it is a different target from Lausanne

[Söhne](https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/soehne/) (Kris Sowersby / Klim Type
Foundry) was added as a reference. Its own name table reads *"Copyright 2025
Klim Type Foundry. All Rights Reserved."*, it carries a trademark notice, and
the supplied files are **trial** fonts under
<https://klim.co.nz/licences/>. Ultra Sans is not and cannot be derived from
it — trial fonts are for evaluation, and the outlines are proprietary
regardless. It is used here only as an on-screen and measured reference, which
is exactly what a trial font is for. Copies live in `refs/`, which is
gitignored and must never be committed or shipped.

Fitting Inter's `opsz` axis to each reference's lowercase advance widths:

| Reference | Best-fit Inter `opsz` | RMS width error |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Söhne Buch | **27.0** | 1.86% |
| TWK Lausanne | **16.65** | 2.27% |

**They are opposite ends of the same axis.** Söhne's `o` is 0.564 em against
Lausanne's 0.598 — 5.7% narrower. You cannot chase both. Vertical proportions
do agree, which is why either fit works at all: Söhne x/cap 0.728, Lausanne
0.724, Inter at `opsz` 27 sits at 0.720.

`references.html` shows the fit. At 15px body the fitted Inter and Söhne break
the line at the identical word, while the then-current Inter configuration ran
wider.

**What width-fitting does and does not buy.** Matching advances to under 2% RMS
matches the *rhythm and colour* of a block of text — the thing you perceive
before you read. It does not change the letterforms: Söhne's `a`, `R`, `t` and
`G` stay Söhne's, and Inter's stay Inter's. That gap is outlines, not metrics.

**The tradeoff measured in this experiment.** `font-optical-sizing: auto` maps
CSS px onto Inter's `opsz` axis. Pinning 27 everywhere would hold Söhne's
proportions but give up Inter's optical compensation at small sizes — the
widening and opening that exists to aid reading. Söhne makes the same compromise
by being static. Pinning at display only while leaving `auto` for body keeps the
compensation at the cost of not being "true Söhne" throughout.

## Known limitation of the Inter experiment: italic

**Inter Italic has no single-storey `a`.** The `geometric` recipe transplants
193 glyphs in roman but only 158 in italic, and `cv11` is reported skipped. Its
roman and italic would not match — an italic word would silently revert to the
double-storey form mid-sentence. `calm` has no such gap; it applies identically
to both faces.

Fixing this means drawing an italic single-storey `a` (and its ~34 accented
composites) in a real font editor against Inter's UFO sources. That is
outside what this pipeline does.

## Licensing

Inter is SIL OFL 1.1 and declares **no Reserved Font Name** — the copyright line
is bare, with no "with Reserved Font Name" clause. Renaming and redistributing a
modified version is therefore permitted outright. Obligations we meet:

- The upstream copyright (name ID 0) and license (IDs 13/14) travel in every
  built binary, with our derivative note appended rather than substituted.
- `OFL-1.1.txt` is copied into `build/` on every run.
- Any derivative must itself ship under OFL 1.1 and may not be sold on its own.

`build_ultra_sans.py` deliberately does not touch name IDs 0, 13 or 14.

## Release boundary

This repository owns the editable geometry, pinned source inputs, build logic,
specimens, provenance, and release font binaries. Product repositories should
consume a tagged artifact and define their own CSS roles; application styling
and integration tests do not belong here. The older `build_ultra_sans.py`
outputs remain research-only and never enter `fonts/`.
